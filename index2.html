    <p>Let's get down, let's get down to business</p>
    <p>Give you one more night, one more night to get this</p>
    <p>We've had a million, million nights just like this</p>
    <p>So let's get down, let's get down to business</p>
    <p>Mama, please don't worry 'bout me</p>
    <p>'Cause I'm about to let my heart speak</p>
    <p>My friends keep telling me to leave this</p>
    <p>So let's get down, let's get down to business</p>
    <p>Let's get down, let's get down to business</p>
    <p>Give you one more night, one more night to get this</p>
    <p>We've had a million, million nights just like this</p>
    <p>So let's get down, let's get down to business</p>
    <p>Let's get down, let's get down to business</p>
    <p>Give you one more night, one more night to get this</p>
    <p>We've had a million, million nights just like this</p>
    <p>So let's get down, let's get down to business, yeah</p>
    <p>Back and forth, back and forth with the bullshit</p>
    <p>I know I said it before, I don't mean it</p>
    <p>It's been a while since I had your attention</p>
    <p>So it might hurt to hear this</p>
    <p>Dreams we have don't ever fall away</p>
    <p>We can't live 'em if we stay the same</p>
    <p>And I can't do this for another day</p>
    <p>So let's get down, let's get down to business</p>
